<h1>Four new orchid species from the Lengguru fold belt, West Papua, Indonesia</h1>
<h2>Lina Juswara, André Schuiteman, Vincent Droissart</h2>
<ul><li>DOI:10.3897/phytokeys.61.7590</li></ul>
        <b>Abstract</b>
        <p><i><i>Bulbophyllum</i><i>leucoglossum</i></i>, <i><i>Dendrobium</i><i>centrosepalum</i></i>, <i><i>Dendrobium</i><i>taeniocaule</i></i>, and <i><i>Taeniophyllum</i><i>pyriforme</i></i> are here described as new species, based on herbarium specimens collected from the Lengguru fold-and-thrust belt in the West Papua Bird’s neck, Indonesian New Guinea. All four novelties were found growing in submontane forest (elevation &gt; 1000 m a.s.l.) on limestone karst. Information concerning the distribution and habitat for these taxa is provided along with diagnostic features, line drawings, high resolution photographs, and a map of collecting localities. More field studies are required to find additional populations of these new species, in order to better characterize their habitat, ecology and conservation status.</p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Indonesia has been classified as a megadiverse country (<a href="#B2">Mittermeier et al. 1997</a>), and is estimated to house approximately 10% (30,000 species) of the botanical diversity of the world (<a href="#B8">World Resources Institute et al. 2005</a>). The country is composed of over thirteen thousand islands lining the equator. The largest island, New Guinea, is also known to harbour one of the richest orchid floras in the world, only surpassed by Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru (<a href="#B4">Schuiteman and de Vogel 2007</a>). <a href="#B3">Ormerod (2014)</a> recorded c. 2870 species of orchids from New Guinea, 11% of the world’s orchid flora, of which about 95 percent are endemic to the island (<a href="#B5">Schuiteman et al. 2001-2010</a>). Considering that large parts of New Guinea still have low collecting densities, it is likely, as also suggested by Ormerod, that many species still await discovery here.</p>
      <p>The island has a complex geological history, related to the tectonics of the Indo-Australian and Pacific plates. The Lengguru fold-and-thrust belt (<a href="#B1">Bailly et al. 2009</a>) was formed by the collision of the Australian and Pacific plates, and is characterized by a series of parallel and oblique folds separated by deep valleys, which link the high mountains of the Central Range of western Papua to the moderately high mountains of the Bird’s neck. According to <a href="#B7">Vollering et al. (2016)</a>, the orchid species diversity in this part of New Guinea, which at present has a very low collecting density, is predicted to be relatively low, compared to the high diversity of the Eastern Highlands and Chimbu provinces of Papua New Guinea. This prediction was based on species distribution modelling using occurrence records of 532 species and spatial environmental data. It will be interesting to see if the prediction holds up once the area is better known botanically.</p>
      <p>In October–November 2014, the first and the last authors took part in the Lengguru 2014 scientific expedition (<span style="background-color:green;color:white;">www.lengguru.org</span>). One of the main objectives of this multi-disciplinary research programme was to make a rapid but wide-ranging assessment of the botanical diversity in a major Papuan karst region. The ultimate goals are to generate species plant checklists for this poorly sampled area, and to incorporate these data into a regional database to further analyse plant distribution patterns at different scales.</p>

      <p>During the Lengguru expedition, we sampled 26 different sites in the limestone karst landscape (primarily swamp forest, mature lowland forest, alluvial forest, and submontane forest) from the sea shore to the top of the anticlines at around 1500 m elevation, in three main localities: Lobo village, Triton Bay; Urisa village, Arguni Bay; and Nusa Ulan, Kumawa Forest Reserve (Fig. 1). We gathered 72 fertile/flowering orchid specimens and associated material (pictures, silica-gel samples). We also collected living orchid specimens, which are now being cultivated in the Kebun Raya, Bogor (West Java) and in the Wamena Biological Gardens (Papua). Detailed examinations and comparisons with nomenclatural types of related species present in New Guinea, allowed us to identify four new species in the genera <i><i>Bulbophyllum</i></i> Thouars, <i><i>Dendrobium</i></i> Sw., and <i><i>Taeniophyllum</i></i> Blume. These novelties are described in the present paper, complemented with line drawings, photos, and information on habitats and distribution. As far as we now know, all four new species are endemic to the submontane forests of the Lengguru fold belt, at elevations above 1000 m.</p>

      <h2>Materials and methods</h2>
      <p>Most orchid collections from the Lengguru expedition were preserved in Copenhagen mix (ethanol 70% and 5% glycerol). Specimens are deposited mainly in <span>BO</span>, with some duplicates in <span>MAN</span>, K, P and L (herbarium acronyms according to Thiers, continuously updated). Measurement and drawing of vegetative and reproductive parts were made on liquid preserved specimens, using a Wild Heerbrugg Switzerland Type 308700 stereo microscope. Additional data such as colour, habitat or ecology are mainly derived from field notes and high resolution pictures taken during the expedition.</p>

          <b>Diagnosis.</b>
          <p>Similar to <i><i>Bulbophyllum</i><i>pyroglossum</i></i> Schuit. &amp; de Vogel because of the hinged lip and the hair-like appendages on the surface of the lip, but in that species the appendages are about four times longer, and they are discrete, subulate projections arranged in rows, not forming densely lacerate-fimbriate keels as in <i><i>Bulbophyllum</i><i>leucoglossum</i></i>. Moreover, <i><i>Bulbophyllum</i><i>leucoglossum</i></i> has two lamellae on the abaxial (concave) side of the lip; these are lacking in <i><i>Bulbophyllum</i><i>pyroglossum</i></i>. The latter also has much broader and shorter petals, and an orange instead of a white lip.</p>

          <b>Description.</b>
          <p>Epiphytic <i>herb</i>. <i>Rhizome</i> short, creeping; <i>roots</i> wiry, branching, 0.5 mm diam. <i>Pseudobulbs</i> closely spaced, light green, narrowly ovoid, 2.0–2.4 × 0.7–0.8 cm, with c. 10 longitudinal grooves, 1-leaved. <i>Leaf</i> deeper green, linear-elliptic, gradually narrowed towards the base, 8.8–10.3 × 1.3–1.4 cm, thin-coriaceous, apex acute. Inflorescences arising from the base of the pseudobulb, becoming fascicled, erect, 1-flowered. <i>Peduncle</i> wiry, erect-patent, 1-flowered, 7–9 cm long, glabrous, with two tubular, 4 mm long peduncle-scales. <i>Floral bract</i> tubular, strongly oblique, 4.5 mm long, apex acuminate. <i>Pedicel-with-ovary</i> terete, very slender, weakly 6-ribbed, almost straight or curved, c. 2.5 cm long, glabrous. <i>Flowers</i> opening widely, the sepals patent to reflexed; sepals and petals maroon; lip white, at base wine-red, basal part of the keels sulphur-yellow; column cream-colour tinged maroon, swollen basal part and foot light green; anther pale greenish. <i>Dorsal sepal</i> linear-oblong, 14.3 × 2.8 mm, 3-veined, apex acute. <i>Lateral sepals</i> free, obliquely linear-oblong, 13.4 × 3.3 mm, 3-veined, apex acute. <i>Petals</i> linear-oblong, slightly widened towards the base, glabrous, 2.6 × 0.8 mm, apex obtuse. <i>Lip</i> clawed, slightly mobile, attached to the column-foot by a 0.3 mm long, 0.4 mm wide ligament; claw in the basal half almost quadrangular, tapering towards the blade, 2.4 × 1.5 mm, glabrous, with erect, hemi-elliptic, lobe-like margins in the basal half; blade narrowly oblong, slightly tapering towards the apex, cucullate, strongly convex above, 9.7 × 2.3 mm, margins deflexed, finely lacerate-fimbriate; blade adaxially with one median keel and two lateral keels on each side, the keels finely lacerate-fimbriate; on the concave abaxial side with two lacerate-fimbriate lamellae; apex obtuse. <i>Column</i> 2.3 mm long, curved, strongly swollen at the base, with a short but distinct, thick, 1 mm long column-foot; apical column-wings each with two short obtuse teeth, the wings 0.4 mm wide; <i>stigma</i> in lateral view with protruding lower margin; <i>anther</i> helmet-shaped, 0.6 mm long, very slightly papillose; <i>pollinia</i> not seen.</p>


          <b>Distribution and habitat.</b>
          <p><i><i>Bulbophyllum</i><i>leucoglossum</i></i> is only known from the Lengguru fold belt in West Papua. It is currently recorded from a single location in the Kumawa Forest Reserve, near the village of Nusa Ulan (Fig. 1). The only population seen so far was found in submontane forest at 1005 m elevation, the plants growing epiphytically about 1.5 m from the ground on a slender, moss-grown, overhanging tree trunk in medium-sloping terrain. More than ten individuals were observed in the collecting locality, but only one was flowering at the time of our fieldwork (November).</p>


          <b>Etymology.</b>
          <p>From the Greek <i>leuco</i>-, white, and <i>glossum</i>, tongue, referring to the largely pure white lip.</p>


          <b>Notes.</b>
          <p>A distinctive species because of the five laciniate-fimbriate keels on the lip, which give it a hairy appearance. The only other known species in the large section <i>Codonosiphon</i> with a distinctly hairy-looking lip is <i><i>Bulbophyllum</i><i>pyroglossum</i></i> Schuit. &amp; de Vogel from Papua New Guinea, which is similar in plant habit and in the size of the flower. See the diagnosis for the main differences between the two species.</p>

          <b>Diagnosis.</b>
          <p>The short and dense inflorescences with small, purple flowers and green-tipped, long-apiculate sepals resemble those of <i><i>Dendrobium</i><i>purpureum</i></i> Roxb., a lowland species from Maluku and Sulawesi. However, the plant habit of the latter is completely different, as <i><i>Dendrobium</i><i>purpureum</i></i> has robust, many-leaved, cane-like, tufted stems up to more than 50 cm long. Vegetatively, <i><i>Dendrobium</i><i>centrosepalum</i></i> is more similar to <i><i>Dendrobium</i><i>aurantiroseum</i></i> P.Royen ex T.M.Reeve from New Guinea, which also has unifoliate pseudobulbs on a creeping rhizome. However, the latter is a species from high elevations (2100–3350 m) with pink flowers that are about twice as large, while the sepals are not apiculate; in addition, the cross-ridge on the lip is situated below the middle in <i><i>Dendrobium</i><i>aurantiroseum</i></i> and above the middle in <i><i>Dendrobium</i><i>centrosepalum</i></i>.</p>

          <b>Notes.</b>
          <p>The small, bright purple flowers in short and dense inflorescences superficially resemble those of such species as <i><i>Dendrobium</i><i>dichaeoides</i></i> Schltr. and <i><i>Dendrobium</i><i>limpidum</i></i> Schuit. &amp; de Vogel, but these are quite different vegetatively, having elongate, leafy stems; in addition, in these two species the sepals are not sharply apiculate. See the diagnosis for additional comparisons.</p>

          <b>Description.</b>
          <p>Epiphytic <i>herb</i>. <i>Rhizome</i> short, creeping; <i>roots</i> 1 mm diam., minutely verrucose. <i>Pseudobulbs</i> erect, yellowish green, elongate, bilaterally flattened, 16–21 × 0.4–0.5 cm; internodes 2.3–2.6 cm long, each internode narrowed towards the base; leafy throughout, except for two or three basal internodes; 6–8-leaved. <i>Leaves</i> deep green, long-lived, patent, oblong, 2.0–3.3 × 0.6–0.9 cm; apex unequally bilobed; sheath much shorter than the internode. <i>Inflorescence</i> arising from the apex of the internodes in the upper part of the stem, sympodially branching with age, with up to 3 branches, each branch 3–8 mm long, 1-flowered; peduncle c. 6 mm long, covered with scales in the basal part. <i>Floral bract</i> triangular, closely appressed, 2.9 mm long, apex apiculate. <i>Pedicel</i> 2.6 mm long ovary at right angles to the pedicel, 2.6 mm long, glabrous; at the base of the pedicel with an abortive rachis. <i>Flower</i> 10.3 mm high, glabrous; sepals greenish white, tinged pale purple abaxially and on the mentum; petals pale green; lip white; column pale green suffused with purple; anther pale green. <i>Dorsal sepal</i> broadly ovate, 4.1 × 3.3 mm, 5-nerved, obtuse. <i>Lateral sepals</i> obliquely broadly ovate, the free part 5.3 × 4.3 mm, 5-nerved, obtuse; mentum cylindrical, 3.6 mm long, apex rounded, the closed apical part 2.8 mm long. <i>Petals</i> linear-oblong, 4.4 × 1.2 mm, acuminate, 3-nerved, margin in upper third finely papillose. <i>Lip</i> 3-lobed, clawed, when flattened 6.7 × 8.5 mm excluding the c. 4 mm long, linear claw; lateral lobes subfalcate-oblong, patent, 2.7 × 1.0 mm; mid-lobe clawed, bilobulate (the whole lip appearing 4-lobulate), 5.7 × 8.5 mm; mid-lobe claw obtrapeziform, 1.7 × 4.4. mm; lobules of the mid-lobe rectangular-orbicular, 3.3 × 4.2 mm; the whole of the lip, except for the lateral lobes and the lobules of the mid-lobe, occupied by a sharply delimited swelling, which has two broad longitudinal crests with a narrow rib in between and which projects backwards over the claw of the lip for 0.3 mm. <i>Column</i> broadly conical in front view, 1.7 mm long, wings very short, truncate; foot 3.6 mm long; <i>stigma</i> large, 1.6 mm wide, rostellum a simple transverse ridge; <i>anther</i> cucullate-rectangular, 1.1 mm wide, glabrous; <i>pollinia</i> not seen.</p>


          <b>Distribution and habitat.</b>
          <p><i><i>Dendrobium</i><i>taeniocaule</i></i> is only known from the Lengguru fold belt in West Papua. It is currently recorded from a single locality in the Triton Bay area, near the village of Lobo (Fig. 1). The only population seen so far was found in submontane forest at 1114 m elevation, the plants growing epiphytically on a vertical, lichen-covered trunk of a tree.</p>


          <b>Etymology.</b>
          <p>From the Greek <i>taenia</i>, a band or strap, and <i>caulon</i>, stem; referring to the flattened, band-shaped pseudobulbs.</p>


          <b>Notes.</b>
          <p>This species has only one obvious close relative, which is the widespread <i><i>Dendrobium</i><i>viridiflorum</i></i>. Uniquely in section <i>Brevisaccata</i>, these two species share flattened stems and abbreviated inflorescences that produce up to 3, 1-flowered branches in succession over a longer period. The other species in the section have terete stems and flowers produced simultaneously on elongate racemes. In addition to clear morphological differences, as indicated in the diagnosis, the two first-mentioned species also have different ecologies. While <i><i>Dendrobium</i><i>viridiflorum</i></i> is exclusively found in mangroves and coastal forest below 200 m, <i><i>Dendrobium</i><i>taeniocaule</i></i> occurs in submontane forest above 1000 m.</p>

          <b>Diagnosis.</b>
          <p>Differs from all known species in sect. <i><i>Loboglossum</i></i> by the finely muricate peduncle and the hook-like basal lobules of the lateral lobes of the lip.</p>


          <b>Type.</b>
          <p>Indonesia, West Papua Province, Kaimana Regency, Lobo village, Triton Bay, <span style="background-color:green;color:white;">03°43.7962'S, 134°3.5962'E</span>, 28/10/2014, <i>Droissart &amp; Juswara 1735</i> (holotype: <span>BO</span>!, spirit material).</p>


          <b>Description.</b>
          <p>Leafless epiphytic <i>herb</i>. <i>Stem</i> very short; <i>roots</i> spreading, green, flattened, not branching, up to at least 35 cm long, 1.5–3 mm wide; some of the roots closely appressed to the bark of the phorophyte, others free hanging. <i>Inflorescences</i> c. 3 producing flowers at the same time, suberect, 5–6 cm long; peduncle filiform, 0.5 mm diam., rather sparsely muricate with c. 0.3 mm long projections; near the middle with a very small peduncle-scale; rachis distichous, glabrous, up to c. 16-flowered, with the flowers opening in succession, one or two at a time, gradually elongating, up to 11–14 mm long. <i>Floral bracts</i> cupular, in lateral view triangular, subacute, 1.2 mm long; successive bracts on the same side of the rachis 1.8 mm apart. <i>Flowers</i> apparently non-resupinate (always?), c. 5 mm high including the spur, glabrous, pale brownish yellow. <i>Dorsal sepal</i> ovate, 3.3 × 1.5 mm, obtuse, 3-veined. <i>Lateral sepals</i> somewhat obliquely ovate, 2.6 × 1.3 mm, obtuse; 3-veined; abaxially at the apex with a short lamella along the midvein. <i>Petals</i> obliquely ovate, 3.2 × 1.5 mm, obtuse, 3-veined. <i>Lip</i> spurred, 3-lobed, ecallose, margins erect to incurved, when flattened 2.7 × 3.2 mm; lateral lobes semi-oblong, rounded, 2.0 mm long from base of lip to base of mid-lobe, at the base with an erect, narrowly triangular-uncinate lobule; mid-lobe reniform, 0.7 × 1.2 mm, emarginate. <i>Column</i> short, cylindrical, 1.1 long, 1.0 mm wide, with a short, bidentate rostellum; <i>stigma</i> shallowly concave; <i>anther</i> cucullate, 0.9 cm long, 0.6 cm wide, apex rostrate, recurved; <i>pollinia</i> not seen.</p>


          <b>Distribution and habitat.</b>
          <p><i><i>Taeniophyllum</i><i>pyriforme</i></i> is only known from Papua. It is recorded from a single locality near the village of Lobo in the Triton Bay (Fig. 1). The only population seen so far was found in submontane forest at 1114 m elevation, the plants growing epiphytically on a sparsely moss-covered tree trunk at 1.5 m above the ground.</p>


          <b>Etymology.</b>
          <p>From the Latin <i>pyriforme</i>, pear-shaped, referring to the shape of the spur.</p>


          <b>Notes.</b>
          <p>This inconspicuous but distinctive species would seem to fit best in section <i>Loboglossum</i>, on account of the clearly lobed lip, elongate inflorescence, distichous rachis, and glabrous ovary. However, a muricate inflorescence has not been reported for this section before (although the otherwise very different <i><i>Taeniophyllum</i><i>toranum</i></i> J.J.Sm. is described as having a furfuraceous-punctate peduncle and rachis, while the no less distinct <i><i>Taeniophyllum</i><i>pulvinatum</i></i> is said to have a minutely glandulose peduncle). The basal, hook-like lobules on the lip are also unique.</p>
          <p>It is likely that a large number of species of <i><i>Taeniophyllum</i></i> still await discovery in New Guinea. We believe this to be the case because most of the species are easily overlooked; the flowers often last only a day or less; and many of the known species are only recorded from the type. New Guinea is clearly the centre of diversity for this genus, with 130 species currently recorded.</p>



      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <p>The four new species described here demonstrate that, most likely, many new species still await discovery in poorly explored parts of New Guinea. Among our collections from the Lengguru area, 1 out of 8 species of <i><i>Bulbophyllum</i></i>, 2 of 22 <i><i>Dendrobium</i></i> species, and 1 of 2 <i><i>Taeniophyllum</i></i> species proved to be new to science, and 3 of these novelties were collected on the same day near Lobo village. This only represents species found in flower during our expedition, which is certainly a minority of the total orchid flora of the area.</p>
      <p>The new species of <i><i>Bulbophyllum</i></i> and <i><i>Dendrobium</i></i> described here, while distinctive, do not present striking new features for these genera; they are easily classified among the known species. The new <i><i>Taeniophyllum</i></i>, on the other hand, appears to be without any obvious close relatives. This genus in particular warrants much more attention from scientific collectors and taxonomists; the diversity and phylogenetics of this genus are still poorly understood.</p>
